# Machine Learning Project with Scikit-Learn

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Scikit-Learn to build and evaluate a machine learning model. The goal is to do a project for Platzi class [Data.csv].

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.



## Summary

1. **Best learning strategy with a large amount of labeled data**: Supervised learning.
2. **Can all AI problems be solved with Machine Learning techniques?**: False.
3. **Limitation of scikit-learn**: It cannot extend its functionality with external libraries.
4. **Can effective and robust ML applications be created without proper mathematical foundations?**: Yes, with validation methods and extensive testing.
5. **Importance of creating a virtual environment using virtualenv**: To isolate libraries, their versions, and the interpreter between different projects.
6. **Is Machine Learning a tool to improve quality of life and achieve happiness?**: True.
7. **High variance in results means**: Model predictions can deviate significantly from expectations.
8. **Underfitting in a model means**: It has not been able to generalize due to complexity or amount of available information.
9. **PCA is a technique for**: Dimensionality reduction.
10. **Covariance matrix applied to a dataset shows**: The correlation between all features.
11. **Kernel in the context of machine learning**: The core of the selected algorithm for its application.
12. **Module in scikit-learn for PCA algorithms**: feature_selection.
13. **Fundamental principle of regularization**: Increase bias slightly to reduce variance in results.
14. **Regularization that drives insignificant values to zero**: Lasso.
15. **Is Lasso regularization always better than Ridge for all cases?**: False.
16. **Technique not used to identify outliers**: Calculation of the..
